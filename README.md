# Networking notes

## Content

This repo is a part of my personal notes, gathered during my overall networking studies.

Note! None of those notes were generated by AI. They all come from my personal, manual notes and real studies.

## Limitations

I am a big fan of Obsidian, so all notes include some additional meta data. You can use them in your own Obsidian notes or ignore them.

Since I usually transform my notes to mindmaps, some markdown lists contain additional formatting, so it's easier for my python script to make appropriate decisions while creating plantuml diagrams.
